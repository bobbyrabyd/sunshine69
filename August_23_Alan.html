Stones me like nothing I know, that blue bourbon.  Codeine <A NAME="2"></A>comes from Opium comes from Vietnam, some.  Sometimes wish they'd take me in the army just to get my hands on that poppy.  Shit.<br><br>Why I came to and see this one nobody but the devil can explain--and someone's got some explaining to do!  It seems curious enough at first:  a good title like <I>Bad Day at Black Rock</I> and the marquee says starring my favorite renegade, his last role before he bought the farm.  Second run--due to the bitch from Bryn Mawr getting an Oscar out of it last year--and therefore affordable for a matinee when nothing is on at the club.  <br><br>College girl of the upper crust brings home her boyfriend:  guess what!?  He's a knee-grow!  Seems easy enough:  get him the HELL out of there, preferably with a little <A HREF= "Angel.html#1"> pain</A> to make the point, and hook her up with some letter-sweater stud her own color.  But my man Spence doesn't lift a finger, just grumbles a little and becomes practically indifferent by the end.  His last fucking picture!  A tragic part.  All so claustrophobic:  one set, and myself set down in front with a pot of popcorn like I'm the silent fifth guest at dinner or something.  At the bottom, I crack buttery duds like biting bullets in that darkened theater.<br><br>Admittedly I'm a little stoned in that codeine drone, which nails me to my seat and makes the whole process of witnessing on-screen miscegenation more arduous than formerly believed tolerable.  I squirmed less during <I>Night of the Living Dead</I>--which in its own way had some strange stuff going on between a darky and the dame.  But in that one everybody was punished in the end.<br><br>So stoned.  Is that white at his neck?  Maybe it's a modern Jolson in blackface, and the whole role's a farce . . . nope:  it's the real thing.  You can tell by the lips.  Brother with a French name--I think it's the kid from <I>Blackboard Jungle</I>, gone to college!--oddly persuasive; neat teeth flashing.  Everything going in and out of focus and I feel like I'm being hypnotized by his weird rap, <I>nothing the matter with cross-breeding</I>--figure that!  I bolt from the front row and throw the bucket at the screen.  The manager, a ticket-ripper in a monkey suit, gets in my way and simpers, "I apologize for the projection, sir!"  I don't know if it's his first mistake today, but I bet it's his biggest.  BOOM!  One shot and he's on the sticky floor squirming, pant cuffs up ridiculously over his skinny, gartered legs.  Fucking fairy.  <br><br>HOW CAN YOU SHOW THIS SHIT?  THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE OUR WOMEN AWAY!  I leave blinking into the day wishing Spencer Tracy--I think the town was Tracy, too . . . strange--were around to punch out.  That's how they'll do their uprising, if you ask me.  Not through Black Power and Panthers and in military formation--that's all just decoy.  But by segregation, and <A HREF= "Haunted.html#2"> magazines</A>, and the equal rights people in Hollywood:  invasion of the body snatchers is what it is.  An allegory for the modern age.  Except they don't look just like us:  they're black!<br><br>I'm pretty stoned. </FONT><Pre></pre><center><A href="August.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0  HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><img border=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><a href="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign the guestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML></HTML>
