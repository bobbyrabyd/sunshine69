My leg is not so long, Knife is. When I dive like a swan it is because Knife has found its object andswings my arm behind it.  Knife is an agent, and I am Knife's keeper. Knife has no wings but can fly.  And the short, swift leaps are thehardest, requiring whole days of disuse and psychic preparation.  <br><br><A HREF= "November_1_Sunshine.html"> When I go back to Mystic Arts</A> itis for blood. Been four weeks without a fix and I had enough of <A HREF="October_1_Alan.html"> blacks bothering me</A> the first of the month andHalloween left me wanting to test drive this knife . . . at least enoughto shake up <A HREF= "September_1_Alan.html"> that nigger chick</A>.

She licks my tit!  <br></FONT><br><p><p><p><center><A href="November.html"><IMG border =0 HSPACE="9" SRC ="images/calendar.gif"></a><A href="69_Suits.html"><IMG border =0HSPACE="9" SRC = "images/people.gif"></a><a href="69_8_track.html"><imgborder=0 HSPACE="9" src="images/8track.gif"></a><ahref="69_Map.html"><img border=0 hspace=12 src="images/map.gif"></a><p><Center><FONT SIZE="2" color="#5B1303"><ahref="guestbook.html"><B>pssst. . .sign theguestbook!</B></a></FONT></center><P><Center><ahref="http://www.sonicnet.com"><FONT SIZE="2">back to <img border=0src="images/soniclogosmall.gif"></a></center><br><BR>  </BODY></HTML>
